                    We believe Christ is central to who we are and what we do. This applies to each believer and the church as a whole. All that we are and all that we do is 
                    for His glory. We are committed to helping our members develop an intimate and meaningful relationship with Christ through prayer; a relationship that leads 
                    to hope, purpose and fulfilment. We emphasise the importance of submission to His Lordship under which members discover the awesome impact of letting God 
                    and His will be our first priority. As we live out our Christian life as God intends, we become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of

                    We believe in the importance of being Spirit-filled and Spirit-led. We emphasise reliance on the Holy Spirit in every facet of our personal and church life. 
                    It is through the God’s Spirit that life transformation occurs and every spiritual gift mentioned in God’s Word can be and should be manifested today. Thus, 
                    we encourage every member to experience the fullness of the Holy Spirit and be empowered to expand His kingdom. It is also the Holy Spirit that reveals Christ 
                    to us and leads us. [Zechariah 4:6, Acts 1:8, Galatians 5:16-18, Romans 12:6-8, 1 Corinthians 12]

                    We believe our faith and practice as Christians is founded and built upon biblical principles. We emphasise expository preaching and balanced comprehensive 
                    teaching so that our members may understand, live out and mature in the Christian life as God intended. Anointed expository preaching allows God’s Word to 
                    be expounded in a balanced and complete manner within its proper context to bring about life transformation. We are committed to developing a wide range of 
                    relevant teaching programmes to meet the needs of the members in the areas of Bible knowledge, Christian living and ministry. [2 Timothy 3:16-17,

                <p class="corevalues4-content-p">
                    We believe that God is a covenantal God. He seeks people who are committed to Him and His purpose, and with one another. We believe an appropriate response 
                    to God’s covenant involves loving, honouring and worshipping Him above all else. This flows from our belief that God is the Supreme Creator and has planned 
                    all things in His good will. God is love and He desires to form an eternal family among whom He will dwell. We seek to develop covenantal relationships among 
                    believers through committing to love and build up one another. We are committed to forgive one another, resolve differences and reconcile relationships resulting 
                    in a deeper bond in unity. [Genesis 1:1, Daniel 10:21, Ephesians 1:3-10, Hebrews 1:1-4, Revelation 5:1-5, 10:1-7, Exodus 20:3, Psalm 96:9, 1 John 4:13-21, Revelation 21:1-7, Matthew 6:9-13]

                    We believe in the importance of a God given, biblical vision that requires nothing less than our obedience to fulfilling the entirety of God’s vision for 
                    the church. We are passionate with the vision to fulfil the Great Commission by raising Christ-centred disciples to plant vibrant biblical churches within 
                    every area of all nations in the world. The vision also includes impacting our society in every sphere of human endeavour for Christ. We believe that such a

                    We believe the core command of the Great Commission is to make Disciples of Christ. We aim to raise disciples who are passionate for God, people and the 
                    Great Commission. We aim to raise disciples who continually grow in Christ-like attitudes, values and Kingdom-focused lifestyle. We aim to nurture disciples 
                    who follow the example of Christ in humility, are submissive in attitude and sacrificial in service. We aim to make disciples who choose to submit their 
                    lives and desires to God, as shown by our respect and submission to God’s Word, our leaders and one another. Zealous people, who live holy lives, are full 
                    of faith, and desire excellence in their lives and ministry. Disciples who will in turn make more disciples. We encourage every member to be this kind of

                    key vehicle to expand His kingdom. Therefore, our world-missions strategy is to plant vibrant biblical churches in every nation of the world that will permeate through their 
                    entire nation by multiplying local churches. The intention of every church is to reach their community, nation and every ethnic group of the world. [Isaiah 52:7, Luke 4:18-19, Ephesians 3:10]

                    incorporating the five-fold ministry is God’s plan for the end-time Church. We believe that apostolic movements are a critical component of the new structures God is 
                    establishing in His Church to contain the new things that God is outpouring. Thus, we seek to function in the fullness of the five-fold ministries and to raise whole 
                    generations of five-fold ministers. [Ephesians 2:19-22, 3:2-6, 4:11-13]
