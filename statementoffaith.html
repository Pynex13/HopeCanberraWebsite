                    The Bible is the Word of God. It is the absolute truth and therefore is the standard of faith as well as the ultimate handbook for

                    We believe in the one true and eternal God, the Creator of everything. God is one but exists in three persons: the Father, the Son and the 
                    Holy Spirit. Though they are co-equal, coexistent and co-eternal, they play different roles in human history, working together in creation,

                    We believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who was supernaturally conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. 
                    Whilst on earth, He was both perfectly God and perfectly man at the same time, and was without sin. He was crucified on the cross and 
                    physically rose from the dead on the third day to fulfil the will of the Father to provide salvation from sin to those who believe in Him. 
                    He ascended physically to heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. One day in the future, He will come again to establish His kingdom.

                    We believe that the Holy Spirit is God who convicts people of sin and leads them to repent of their sin and place their faith in Jesus for salvation. 
                    He dwells within believers to enable them to lead holy lives and obey God’s will.We believe that all the gifts of the Holy Spirit mentioned in the 
                    Bible remain in the Church today and should be fully exercised to build up the Body of Christ. The baptism of the Holy Spirit, an experience distinct 
                    from repentance and faith in Jesus for salvation, enables Christians to testify of Christ in the power of the Spirit. Speaking in tongues is the normal 
                    initial sign of being baptised in the Holy Spirit.
                    In the Christian life, every believer must live in obedience to Christ and be under the covering of the Holy Spirit. Christians should always be filled 
                    with the Spirit .

                <p class="statementoffaith5-content-p">
                    We believe God created angelic beings for His service. They are supernatural but not divine. The Bible teaches that Satan, together with the many angels 
                    that follow him, are evil, supernatural, angelic beings and that there is a spiritual kingdom on earth under Satan’s authority opposed to God and His plan. 
                    Satan’s kingdom is at war with God’s kingdom. The death and resurrection of Jesus on the cross defeated Satan and enables all men and women who put their 
                    trust in Jesus to join God’s kingdom. The Church has been commissioned to rescue men and women from Satan’s kingdom to God’s, a task which will conclude 
                    when Jesus returns. God will ultimately triumph when Satan’s rule is terminated and his kingdom destroyed.

                    inherited a sinful nature. Since everyone has fallen short of God’s standard because of sin and is subject to God’s wrath and condemnation, they all 
                    need His salvation which is made possible through the death of Jesus Christ; otherwise they will be judged and punished eternally in hell.

                    We believe that we can be saved from God’s wrath when we confess and repent from sin and place our trust in Jesus Christ. Salvation is given by the grace 
                    of God only on the basis of Jesus’ sacrifice for sin when He died on the cross and cannot be achieved by a person’s own works. At the point of salvation, 
                    an individual becomes a new creation in Christ. Through obedience and faith a Christian is gradually transformed to become more like Jesus.

                    We believe that the church is the community of God’s people and central to God’s plan of salvation. Once we become Christians, we are adopted into God’s 
                    family and become part of the Universal Church, made up of Christians of every age. Local churches are made up of believers who regularly meet together 
                    in different localities to worship, listen to the Word of God, fellowship, witness, participate in communion, pray and have other activities together. 
                    We believe that every Christian should be committed to a local church.

                    Water baptism is the immersion of a person completely in water as a symbol of the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus. Communion is for Christians 
                    to remember Jesus by partaking of bread and wine as symbols of the flesh and blood of Jesus and the covenant God has made to bring salvation through 
                    faith in Christ. It is practiced in obedience to the command of Jesus and can be celebrated as often as believers gather together until Jesus returns.

                    worshiping with other Christians, using musical instruments, singing and exercising the gifts of the Holy Spirit.
